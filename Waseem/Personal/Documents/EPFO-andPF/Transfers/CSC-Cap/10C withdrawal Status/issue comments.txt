Pension Fund accumulations withdrawal amount is incorrect (Got only Rs 24887)
I worked in below two companies and successfully completed and processed transfer claim to transfer the pension service from previous employer (DXC)
1. DXC (formerly known as CSC) from 09-Sept-2014 to 03-Mar-2017
2. Capgemini from 09-Mar-2017 to 25-Oct-2018

But in EPFO portal my Service date still shows only second company details (which is capgemini from 09-Mar-2017 to 25-Oct-2018) but not the first company service period due to which my Pension Fund Withdrawal amount came incorrect (came only half amount)

Kindly add my CSC service details as well in EPFO for pension fund and initiate my remaining pension fund withdrawal for the period I worked in CSC( currently known as DXC) from 09-Sept-2014 to 03-Mar-2017. 

Note : All transfer claims are settled by previous employer
The issue is with PENSION FUND accumulation (NOT PF ACCUMULATIONS)
